# Curriculum Vitae

My curriculum vitae written in React, TypeScript and Vite. In the future I might turn this into a general purpose CV template.

## Scripts
Usual vite scripts are available:
```bash
npm install
```
```bash
npm run dev
```
```bash
npm run build
```

## Get the PDF

Use the default browser print function to get a PDF, should look nice.
