## Experience

### January, 2022 –  June 2022

Research project (Maastricht University, Netherlands)
Under the supervision of assistant professor Siamak Mehrkanoon

### September, 2021 – January 2022

Research project (Maastricht University, Netherlands)
Under the supervision of assistant professor Siamak Mehrkanoon

### March 10, 2021 – June 3, 2021

Internship/thesis, university of padova (italy)
Under the professor Alberto Testolin I was doing a research project with the title: “Deep learning techniques for epileptic seizure prediction from electroencephalography”. The aim was to build a deep-learning model that predicts if a patient will have a seizure.

### January 20, 2020 – March 31, 2020

Internship, CIMeC (Rovereto, Italy)
I worked on a project that aimed at investigating (1) whether the topographical organization of the cortex can be explained by the anatomical adjacency between functionally and structurally connected brain areas, and (2) whether the individual efficiency in terms of topographical adjacency can predict behavioral efficiency (e.g.reaction times, IQ)

### September 2 2020 – september 20th 2020

Internship, CIMeC (rovereto, italy)
During his internship, Giulio analyzed data from a neuroimaging (FMRI)study on the conceptual organization of actions. In his first project, he learned key FMRI analysis steps (design matrix generation, general linear models, crossmodal multivoxel pattern decoding)and tested whether modifying the onset and duration of events affects decoding accuracy in a target brain area and at the whole brain level. In his second project, he formalized a cognitive model of action concept structure and tested, using representational similarity analysis (RSA), whether this model explains variance in the neural data as well as in behavioral rating data

## Programming Languages

### Python

The librairies I use the most are:

- PyTorch/PyTorch Lightning
- Jax/Flax
- Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Scipy, Matplotlib
- Tensorflow/Keras

My favorite setup for deep learning currently is Jax+Flax, but PyTorch + PyTorch-Lightning is the one I have most experience with.

### JavaScript/TypeScript

Current dev setup:
- TypeScript
- React
- Vite

Other:
- Three.js
- WebGL/GLSL
- Tensorflow.js

### Others
- HTML/CSS
- C
- R
- SQL
- Swift

EXTRA-CURRICULAR Activities
I give private programming and data science lessons.
I work out and run consistently.
I am interested in Vipassana Buddhist meditation, and I have made two retreats.
